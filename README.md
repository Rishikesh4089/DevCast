# DevCast

DevCast is a web-based application designed to assist with **effort and cost estimation** for software development projects. It uses **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend. The application helps software development teams estimate the time and resources required for tasks by analyzing various inputs. 

## Features
- **Cost and Effort Estimation**: Provides reliable calculations based on various input parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React to ensure smooth interaction.
- **Backend with Flask**: Manages the business logic and data flow efficiently.
- **Real-Time Data**: Seamless integration between the frontend and backend ensures accurate and up-to-date estimates.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Database**: (Mention if you are using a database)
